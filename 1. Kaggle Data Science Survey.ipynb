    "-Most pBased on the number of people in each experience category, most of the people who took the survey have just started their career. Over 18,000 people have less than five years of experience coding. The next-highest category is the journeymen, with 5-10 years of experience. After that, there are several people in each of the long-term programmers who have more than 10 years of experience.\n",

    "Average salary seems to increase with experience, but this increase doesn't seem to be linear. There are times when the average salary dips when we move into a category of higher experience. There might be several reasons why this happens, but we don't have any data to help explain this. Overall, being a data professional provides a solid living, based on the reported data."
